## Sequential Counter

This is a seuqential digital counter.

The counter design is located at `./openlane/cntr_example` and the wrappered counter is located at `./openlane/user_project_wrapper`.

Before running the design flow, please make sure the gf180 pds was installed correctly. For the information about switching PDK from `sky130` to `gf180`, you may refer to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-kISttsPbY). (Great thanks to Matt)

Once you have done with pdk setups, you can simply follow the commands below:
```
git clone 
```
